## Introduction

This repository contains the code and datasets for the research paper "Explainable AI for Intrusion Detection and Prevention in Online Social Networks and Network Systems". The research aims to integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques into Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to make them more interpretable, transparent, and trustworthy.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- SHAP
- scikit-learn

### Installation Steps

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Explainable-AI-for-IDP.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:

```bash
cd Explainable-AI-for-IDP
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing module includes data collection, cleaning, and transformation. For more details, refer to the [`data_preprocessing.py`](./data_preprocessing.py) file.

## Feature Selection

Feature selection is performed using dimensionality reduction techniques and feature importance methods. For more details, refer to the [`feature_selection.py`](./feature_selection.py) file.

## Model Training

The model training module includes the training of both traditional machine learning models and deep learning models. For more details, refer to the [`model_training.py`](./model_training.py) file.

## Explainable AI Integration

This module integrates Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) into the trained models for generating explanations. For more details, refer to the [`explainable_ai.py`](./explainable_ai.py) file.

## Usage

To run the entire pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```
